Front End(Angular)

The index.html and core.js are the core components of front-end layer.

The core.js contains the angular controller code to access the REST services and populate the ‘formdata’. Here we create the Angular Module ‘commentModule’ and assign the ‘commentController’ to this.  This controller is responsible for loading the comments while loading the home page, creating the comments and finally removing it.
